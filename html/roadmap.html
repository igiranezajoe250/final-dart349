          Communication plays a crucial role in how two entities or consciousness interact. 
          It is the foundation of cohesive movements throughout separate periods, and different
          forms of communication have dominated the narrative. However, communication that involves technology
          dominates more because it reaches many people and is efficient. This dominance and efficiency come with challenges. 
          One of the challenges I wanted to address in this essay is the Missing Information. This challenge crosses different nationalities and cultures,
          but I focused on Rwanda as my origin country. Rwandan History was transmitted through word of mouth. Due to this fact, not all the information is 
          available for mass either on the internet or in books. As the practice of activism is to bring such matters to the public attention, I wanted to address
          the root of the lack of the framework. The language and intonation best suit this story. The stories are there and are mostly real life, not fiction. But the
          challenge is how to bring them to life. The goal is to find a way to communicate without compromising the originality of the stories we are telling and,
          at the same time, try to keep the normal practice and standards.  <br>
              <br> In my zine project, I started by highlighting the gaps and lack of some pieces of information. I created a book with no information inside.
               One of my roommates asked what those patterns and empty black pages with dates meant. And it was a good start to our conversation to explain to
               him what my project is all about. I hope and believe these topics can be more discussed with more consideration to young people, to give them a perspective 
               of what happened in the past and how life used to be then. In the Rwandan context, some stories will be missing forever because the people who had them are no 
               longer there, but still, there are more stories to explore. I wanted this book to be a start for those who wanted to have a conversation. It's empty because I
                didn't want to give an interpretation of any subject matter.  <br> <br>
